MiSTer is an open source project that aims to recreate various classic computers, game consoles and arcade machines, using modern hardware. It allows software and game images to run as they would on original hardware, using peripherals such as mice, keyboards, joysticks and other game controllers. MiSTer utilizes a readily available FPGA board called the ' DE10-Nano ', which connects to your TV or monitor via HDMI video out. It can also be expanded with various add-ons (such as a 7-port USB hub, SDRAM, and either a Digital I/O or Analog I/O board). The MiSTer project is currently under active development, with new cores, features, and bug-fixes appearing on a regular basis.","title":"Home"},{"location":"#what-is-mister-fpga","text":"MiSTer is an open source project that aims to recreate various classic computers, game consoles and arcade machines, using modern hardware.

We will help you setup your sdcard, then update your MiSTer system, and then show you how to run a game in one of the console cores. Requirements: A MicroSD card (preferably 4GB minimum) A keyboard Your MiSTer connected to the internet (preferably by Ethernet/RJ45 for this first step) 1. Flash Mr. Fusion to MicroSD Mr. Fusion provides a compact image that you can download and flash onto an SD card of any size with a tool like balenaEtcher , Win32 Disk Imager , Apple Pi Baker , or even dd . We're going to use balenaEtcher for this guide. We install balenaEtcher by downloading the latest release for our computer and installing it. Next we're going to download the latest release of Mr. Fusion : Next, we will insert our MicroSD card into our computer and then open balenaEtcher. We will select \"Flash from file\" and navigate to the Mr Fusion file we downloaded a step earlier. Then we need to select our MicroSD card as the target to flash. And click \"Flash!\" Wait for it to complete successfully. If you see \"Flash complete!\" and \"1 Successful target\" then everything worked fine. If the flash fails, try and flash it again or flash a different MicroSD card in case the one you are using is malfunctioning. We can now close balenaEtcher and remove our MicroSD card. 2. Start Mr. Fusion Next we just need to carefully insert our MicroSD card into the DE10-Nano ( NOT the MicroSD slot on the IO board on top! ). Now turn on your DE10-Nano. For a stock DE10-Nano this means just plugging in the barrel plug that was supplied with it. Make sure you do not use an adapter with the wrong voltage!! This could permanently damage your new device! We will wait up to a few minutes for the Mr. Fusion installer to complete. Be patient, or else you may have to start over again. When the MiSTer On Screen Display with fuzzy static behind it appears, that means you have successfully installed the MiSTer software/OS onto your MicroSD. If you have bought your device from a custom supplier, they may have an external power switch either on a y-adapter or somewhere else. Also if you have the Digital IO board there is a power switch on top and should be a power jumper of some kind between the DE10-Nano and the optional USB hub beneath it. Please ask your supplier for assistance if you are unclear on how to hook up the power to your MiSTer. It's better to be safe than sorry! 3. Define your controller(s) Next, if you are going to use a gamepad or joystick or other type of game controller, we can define the inputs. Open the OSD on your keyboard with the F12 key. Press F12 again to switch to the secondary OSD menu. You will see an option to \"Define joystick buttons\". Highlight it and press enter. First it will ask you to press certain buttons in order to detect your controller. If it asks for a button you don't have press the space key (or the USER button on your IO board) to skip. Then it will ask you to press the button you want to assign to each action. If you mess up, don't worry! You can just do it over again. If you aren't sure about a button, you can skip it and come back to it later. 4. Running Downloader to update the MiSTer Finally, we are going to run downloader.sh to update your MiSTer's system files to their most current version. This is a good idea to do occasionally as the cores and main system are updated frequently with new features and fixes. Go back into the secondary OSD by pressing F12, just like you did when you defined your inputs. This time highlight \"Scripts\" and press enter (or A on your gamepad if you defined its inputs). Highlight downloader and run it. This will take quite some time, so go make some tea and relax. :) When it finishes it may either reboot your MiSTer automatically, or it may ask you to press a key or button to continue. Go ahead and press a key to make it reboot if it asks you to. That's it! Wasn't that easy to update your MiSTer? 5. Starting a core and playing a game On the MiSTer, all of the systems being simulated are called \"cores\". For example, there is a SNES core which simulates the hardware of the Super Nintendo Entertainment System (or Super Famicom). From the On Screen Display (OSD) highlight Console and enter, then highlight SNES and enter. This will make the screen go black temporarily while the core loads and your display resyncs. Next, highlight Load ROM and enter. This directory is probably empty. This is because MiSTer does not come preloaded with ROMs, you have to supply those yourself. To load ROMs onto the MiSTer is pretty simple. If you are still connected to the network just go to a file explorer (if using a Windows PC) and type \\\\MiSTer\\sdcard\\ in the bar at the top of the window, and press enter. Then you can access the storage just like regular file storage. If you are not connected to the network and don't want to, you can alternatively power off the MiSTer, remove the MicroSD, insert it into your computer, and acccess this same folder that way. In this \"root\" folder there is a games folder. Enter that one. Inside the games folder there is a SNES folder. That's where we will put our SNES rom (Super Mario World (USA) in this example) that we want to play. Now with our ROM loaded onto the MiSTer's storage, let's play it! Highlight Load ROM again and enter. Now you should see your ROM you transferred on the screen. Highlight it and enter. The game should load successfully. Loading a different core can be done by switching to the second page of the OSD menu in the SNES core by pressing Right on the gamepad or keyboard. This will reveal a lot more options. Core at the top will allow you to change to a different core, Reboot the mister at the bottom will allow you to reboot your MiSTer and start from the Menu core again.","title":"First-Time Setup"},{"location":"setup/first-setup/#first-time-setup","text":"This guide will help you setup your MiSTer for the first time.
