MiSTer has support for a wide variety of input devices. It also has options to configure these devices to fit your needs. Here is a breakdown of some special configurations for various input devices like spinners, gamepads, joysticks, and keyboards.

## What is supported?

Generally speaking, any normal USB HID compatible input device is compatible. Keyboards, arcade spinners, usb adapters for original controllers such as the Raphnet and Daemonbite retro adapters, and even modern console controllers like the DualSense PS5 controller. There is even the Serial Native Accessory Connector, if you have one of the Analog or Digital IO add-on boards, which on supported cores allows you to use original hardware controllers, such as lightguns, which would normally only work with the original system and require zero lag to function.

## Serial Native Accessory Convertor (SNAC)

SNAC adaptors allow you to connect original hardware controllers and peripherals to the MiSTer cores. The cores which support SNAC connections have been specially built to have serial connections exposed to specific pins on the DE10-Nano. That means when you pull the trigger on the NES Zapper while aiming at your CRT, the signals travel almost instantly, similar to how they would on original hardware.

## Using A Mouse

You can also use a mouse for various purposes on the MiSTer. The main purpose for mouse support is for some computer cores which had mice.

One of the cool things you can do is use it as an emulated lightgun with a pointer. And the same way of doing this applies to a wiimote with a powered sensor bar. You can do this by pairing your wiimote to the MiSTer and it will be used as a Mouse when paired.
