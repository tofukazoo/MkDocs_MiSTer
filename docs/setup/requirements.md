There are a few things you will need in order to setup your MiSTer:

## Requirements

* Terasic DE10-Nano
* MiSTer SDRAM Add-On Board (Optional but many cores require it)
* Cooling for the FPGA (Highly recommended)
* MicroSD card (minimum 4GB) and MicroSD Card Reader
* USB OTG Adapter or MiSTer USB Hub Add-On Board (no USB devices will work without this)
* USB Keyboard
* Internet connection
* HDMI Monitor/TV and HDMI Cable

## Where to buy

**DE10-Nano:**

* [Terasic](http://de10-nano.terasic.com)
* [Digikey](https://www.digikey.com/en/products/detail/terasic-inc/P0496/6817231) 
* [Mouser](https://www.mouser.com/ProductDetail/Terasic-Technologies/P0496?qs=sGAEpiMZZMug%252BNZZT2EIMybLXjFfYtXHeZj9cpOi%2FsY%3D)

**SDRAM:**

The MiSTer SDRAM add-on board is required by many cores, like the SNES, NES, Playstation, and Game Boy cores. There are multiple sellers out there which sell these, and you can also assemble it yourself if you are skilled at soldering.

**USB OTG Adapter/Hub:**

Preferably, the MiSTer USB Hub Add-on board which you can assemble yourself if you are good at soldering, or you can buy from the various shops that sell them.

At a minimum, the [MakerSpot Micro USB OTG Hub](https://www.amazon.com/MakerSpot-Accessories-Charging-Extension-Raspberry/dp/B01JL837X8) works very well for the MiSTer, if you are looking for a very cheap option.

**Cooling:**

The SoC FPGA chip on the DE10-Nano is 21.5mm x 21.5mm so a heatsink that is around this size is suitable. If using one larger than these dimensions, please make sure to use care to not let the heatsink touch other electronic components around
